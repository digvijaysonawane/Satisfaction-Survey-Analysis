# Satisfaction-Survey-Analysis
IST 687 project


INTRODUCTION
This project was undertaken for the course IST 687: Introduction to Data Science at the iSchool, Syracuse University. The team was given dataset of Southeast Airlines Satisfaction Survey data of customers flying within United States. This huge quantity of data consisted of 1,29,889 rows and 28 columns. As customer feedback is believed to be a vital tool for the success of an organization, the aim of the project was to carry out data analysis on this data set to gain insight to improve the Net Promoter Score of the Southeast Airlines. 


CONCLUSION
From the whole satisfaction data, we found that our company have more female passengers select Economy class travelling for business. Therefore, this group of customers are our target customer group, and we need to provide better service to satisfy them. Furthermore, since there is a trend to be women-friendly, our company will also pursue to be a women-friendly airline company in the world.
 
Based on the analysis that we performed on the data of female passengers in Economy class who travel for business, we can infer that the following attributes are helpful for improving our service.
Arrival Delay and Departure Delay
We found that when the degree of delay for arrival or departure is high, customers are more possible to be detractors; on the contrary, when the degree is low, they are more possible to be promoters.
Airline Status
We found that most detractors are customers with low airline status and most promoters are customers with higher airline status.
Number of Flight with our airlines
We found that most detractors are customers who have taken a lot of flights with our airlines instead of new customers. But new customers always have good first impression of our airlines.
 
Advices on how to improve our performance:
 
  Number of Flight with our airlines
We are good at giving customers good first image instead of maintaining our old customers. We need to act to maintain our old customer group by giving coupons or using prize points to attract those customers fly a lot with airlines.
Airline Status
Although customers with silver, gold, and platinum airline status are important to us, we need also pay attention to those customers with blue airline status.
Delay Issues
Delay issues are the most important aspect to affect customers’ satisfaction. We should try to avoid all flight delays caused by our airlines’ service. For the inevitable delays, we should compensate our customers timely and help them minimize their lose due to the delays. For example, we can help them change tickets or give them food, water, and accommodation supply.
